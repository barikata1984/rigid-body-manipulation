The original "groud_truth.csv" contained redundant points. To remove the points, performed the following procedures:
1. Ran "split.py"
2. Investigate the resultant .CSVs
    2.1 Normalized all the coordinates
    2.2 Flagged all the points whose mass is greater than zero and absolute differences with the adjacent (above or below to the point on the spreadsheet) points are also greater zero
    2.3 Observed that points whose normalized z coordinates were either of {-0.47~, -0.46~, -0.44~} were redundant. Besides, for the fourth .CSV, the flagged point at -.42~ on the z axis appearred redandant
3. Set the mass and mass density of those points at zero 4. Ran "join.py" then renamed "joined_ground_truth.csv" to "ground_truth.csv"
